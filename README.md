Hey and welcome to my blog, blogv2 (I know, a rather generic name. But I think its kind of cool)

the blog is built with Django, and you would need python to run its server.
I used Anaconda platform, so it should work for you as well.

Ones the setups has been made, get your command prompt into the blogv2 folder (the root) and run into the command - 
								python manage.py runserver
the server should be up and ready so just go to the address -
								http://127.0.0.1:8000/articles/
in your browser and you should run my blog.
	in the future I well make it ever MORE awesome, but for now this is the current version.
