BlogV2
------
Hey and welcome to my blog, blogv2 (I know, a rather generic name. But I think its kind of cool).

The blog is built with Django and requires python to run its server.  
I used `Anaconda` platform, so it should work for you as well.

## Installation
Use the command line to `cd` into the blog's root folder and run the server:
```sh
$ cd BlogV2
$ python manage.py runserver
```

The server should be up and ready so just go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/articles/
In the future I will make it even MORE awesome, but for now this is the current version.
